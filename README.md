This is a basic code learning repository, based off of Michael Hartl's [Learn Enough](https://www.learnenough.com/). It also has some [Test-Driven Development](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/ruby-and-rails/test-driven-development-with-ruby) using Ruby.

# Getting started

To get started run these commands:
       
       $ git clone git@github.com:Braden-077/LearnEnough.git

# Command Line

To get started with our command line, go to the Michael Hartl tutorial for the [command line](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial).

The ```LearnEnough/command_line/terminal_commands.sh``` file has all of the commands that get run during the command line tutorial, and some of the failures and fixes I encountered. 

This tutorial teaches users the command line and it's many uses, methods, and power. To get here, let's run:    

      $ cd command_line
      $ code . 

Note: if you're using text editors like Atom, Vim, Nano, or Sublime, these commands will change. Replace code with ```$ atom .```, ```$ vim .```, ```$ nano .```, or ```$ subl .```.

# Test Driven Development

Note: [Ruby](https://github.com/Braden-077/LearnEnough#ruby) is a prerequisite for Test Driven Development(TDD).

To get started with test driven development, go to the [Ruby on Rails](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/ruby-and-rails) tutorial.

This specific repo only does [Week 1](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/ruby-and-rails/test-driven-development-with-ruby) and Week 2. 

The ```LearnEnough/tdd/tdd_commands.sh``` folder holds the completed code for Test Driven Development week 1 as well as commented failures and fixes. Note: There is no CLI for using these apps. The entire purpose is basic coding challenges and writing tests.

To get started with our Ruby on Rails Test Driven Development, run:

      $ cd tdd
      $ bundle install
      $ code .

Note: if you're using text editors like Atom, Vim, Nano, or Sublime, these commands will change. Replace code with ```$ atom .```, ```$ vim .```, ```$ nano .```, or ```$ subl .```. 

After changing your directory into the Test Driven Development folder or the `tdd` folder, you can see the week one of the tdd apps as well as the week_two apps.
